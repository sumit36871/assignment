    "In this example, the Animal class is defined as an abstract class, which serves as a blueprint for other classes. It has an abstract method make_sound, which must be implemented by any concrete class that inherits from Animal. The Dog class is a concrete class that inherits from Animal and provides an implementation for the make_sound method. An instance of the Dog class can be created, as it has provided an implementation for all of the abstract methods defined in the abstract class. However, it does not make sense to create an instance of the abstract class Animal, as it is not a complete class on its own and cannot be used without being subclassed.\n"
