        "\n",
        "High-level language: Python is a high-level language that abstracts away many of the low-level details of programming. This makes it easier to focus on solving the problem at hand, rather than getting bogged down in details of memory management or other lower-level details.\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans. Python uses a system called reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reference counting keeps track of how many references there are to an object in memory. When the number of references to an object drops to zero, the memory occupied by that object is no longer needed and can be freed.\n",
